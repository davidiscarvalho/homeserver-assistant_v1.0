# Routing Map (Draft)

This maps Slack domain channels to canonical memory locations in the brain vault.

## Channels → Brain Paths
- `#openclaw-todo` → `brain/memory/short_term.md` (active tasks) and `brain/memory/long_term.md` (stable commitments)
- `#openclaw-calendar` → `brain/memory/short_term.md` (near-term scheduling notes)
- `#openclaw-mail-outlook` → `brain/memory/long_term.md` (rules, policies, summaries)
- `#openclaw-mail-gmail` → `brain/memory/long_term.md` (rules, policies, summaries)
- `#openclaw-mail-resumai` → `brain/memory/long_term.md` (rules, policies, summaries)
- `#openclaw-obsidian` → `brain/ontology.md`, `brain/principles.md`, `brain/workflows/*`
- `#openclaw-decisions` → `brain/decisions/decision_log.md`
- `#openclaw-archive` → `brain/memory/archival_rules.md` (reference only)

## Notes
- Decisions are always logged in `brain/decisions/decision_log.md`.
- If an outcome becomes canonical, it must be written to the brain and logged.
